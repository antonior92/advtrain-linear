- Double check zero solution, something seems a bit off. (Maybe with cvxpy)
- Maybe unify cvxpy call under the same interface as linadvtrain
- Add more termination criteria for linadvtrain (ftol, gtol, xtol, maxiter...)
- Adapt magic example to work with standard values from get_radiues
- Add method to compute cut-off point in overparametrized example (see theorem 1)
- Change from gif to single image, 1 d example
- Add diabetes example plot to readme
- Add advantages in readme
- Test default parameter for linadvtrain
