Performance:
- [ ] Change the projection step to cython
- [ ] Maybe change the jacobian computation to cython
Improvements in the implementation
- [ ] Better pre-conditioners
- [ ] Implement Lipschitz sampling
Examples improvements
- [ ] Add performance of default for classificaiton
- [ ] convergence for different datasets:
    - [ ] MNIST
    - [ ] ...
    - [ ]
- [ ] Figure out Figure 4
